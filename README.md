# AKM Cyber Corp's Objectives for AKM

## Our Misson

1) To democratize cybersecurity, making it more accessible and inclusive for all. Starting with no passwords!

2) To collaborate on solutions that inherently mitigate the vast majority of today's cyberattacks. No keys, secrets, tokens or certificates to manage.

3) By providing a significantly simpler cryptographic key management solution, compared to the existing PKI and TLS protocols.

4) To deliver a superior alternative to the current cryptographic security standard of PKI+TLS, for managing and distributing cryptographic bulk encryption keys.

5) To ensure that the provided solution is quantum-safe, capable of withstanding quantum computer attacks, such as via Shor's algorithm.

## What's Next?
* To create a set of GitHub repositories representing AKM code and documenation.
* As an Open Source project, to bring on collaborators. We hope that this will be an exciting adventure.
