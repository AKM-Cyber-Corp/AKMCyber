- 👋 Hi, this is the @QSIFoundation
- 👀 We're here to promote autonomous Quantum-Safe cybersecurity software projects
- 🌱 Autonomous Key Management (AKM) for symmetric cryptography, is one of our first projects
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on alternatives to PKI/TLS using AKM, on new quantum-safe secure transport layer software
- 📫 How to reach us qsif at qsifoundation dot org (or qsif at qsisec dot org)

# Introduction

The QSI Foundation is a non-profit organization with the following five primary objectives:

## 1) To offer a superior alternative to the current cryptographic security standard of PKI+TLS, for managing and distributing cryptographic bulk encryption keys.

## 2) To democratize security, making it more accessible and inclusive for all.

## 3) To ensure that the provided solution is quantum-safe, capable of withstanding quantum computer attacks.

## 4) To provide a significantly simpler cryptographic key management solution compared to the existing PKI and TLS protocols.

## 5) To offer a solution that inherently mitigates the vast majority of today's cyberattacks.
Currently, the QSI Foundation is in the process of creating a GitHub repository, where they will share this groundbreaking solution with the world, making it freely available for public use.
