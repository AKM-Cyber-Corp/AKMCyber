- 👋 Hi, this is the @QSIFoundation
- 👀 We're here to promote autonomous Quantum-Safe cybersecurity software projects
- 🌱 Autonomous Key Management (AKM) for symmetric cryptography, is one of our first projects
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on alternatives to PKI/TLS using AKM, on new quantum-safe secure transport layer software
- 📫 How to reach us qsif at qsifoundation dot org (or qsif at qsisec dot org)

# Introduction

The QSI Foundation is a non-profit organization with the following five primary objectives:

## Our Misson

1) To democratize cybersecurity, making it more accessible and inclusive for all.

2) To collaborate on solutions that inherently mitigate the vast majority of today's cyberattacks.

3) By providing a significantly simpler cryptographic key management solution compared to the existing PKI and TLS protocols.

4) To offer a superior alternative to the current cryptographic security standard of PKI+TLS, for managing and distributing cryptographic bulk encryption keys.

5) To ensure that the provided solution is quantum-safe, capable of withstanding quantum computer attacks.

## What's Nest?
Currently, the QSI Foundation is in the process of creating a GitHub repository, where they will share this groundbreaking solution with the world, making it freely available for public use.
