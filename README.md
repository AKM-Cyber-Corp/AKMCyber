- Hi, this is the @AKMCyber
- We're here to promote autonomous Quantum-Safe cybersecurity software projects
- Autonomous Key Management (AKM) for symmetric cryptography, is one of our first projects
- We're looking to collaborate on alternatives to PKI/TLS using AKM, on new quantum-safe secure transport layer networking software
- How to reach us: bart@akmcyber.com

# Introduction

AKM Cyber Corp has the following five primary objectives:

## Our Misson

1) To democratize cybersecurity, making it more accessible and inclusive for all. Starting with no passwords!

2) To collaborate on solutions that inherently mitigate the vast majority of today's cyberattacks. No keys, secrets, tokens or certificates to manage.

3) By providing a significantly simpler cryptographic key management solution, compared to the existing PKI and TLS protocols.

4) To deliver a superior alternative to the current cryptographic security standard of PKI+TLS, for managing and distributing cryptographic bulk encryption keys.

5) To ensure that the provided solution is quantum-safe, capable of withstanding quantum computer attacks, such as via Shor's algorithm.

## What's Next?
Currently, the AKM Cyber Corp is in the process of creating a GitHub repository, where we will share the draft version of this groundbreaking software project with the world, making it freely available for public use.

We look forward to all public feedback and documentation, specification or code contributions as the QSI Foundation evolves.
